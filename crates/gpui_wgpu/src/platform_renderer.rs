//! `WgpuRenderer` as a window's renderer.
//!
//! A window holds a `Box<dyn gpui_platform::PlatformRenderer>`; this is how the wgpu renderer
//! answers that contract, for the windows that hold one: the wayland and X11 backends, where it
//! is also the default, and Windows, where a factory installs it in place of the Direct3D renderer
//! the backend builds itself.
//!
//! macOS is the one platform left out. A window's renderer there must answer `MacSceneRenderer`,
//! whose layer pointer a wgpu renderer has no answer for yet: the corner the macOS presentation
//! probe measured but did not decide. The module therefore carries one `cfg` — not wasm, not
//! macOS — instead of an item-by-item one.
