//! The Windows module: a Direct3D 12 / `wgpu` producer's surface on GPUI's Direct3D 11 renderer.
//!
//! A producer whose device is not GPUI's renders into a **committed, shared** Direct3D 12 texture
//! and hands GPUI its NT handle. The **renderer** opens it on its own Direct3D 11 device and samples
//! it through a shader resource view — that is the consumer half, `DirectXSource::Shared` — so this
//! module is the **producer** half: allocate the shareable texture, signal the fence, hand over the
//! handles. Ordering is a shared `ID3D12Fence`, which the renderer opens as an `ID3D11Fence` and
//! waits **GPU-side** with `ID3D11DeviceContext4::Wait` — never a CPU poll.
//!
//! Two facts shape this code:
//!
//! - **A placed resource cannot be shared.** `CreateSharedHandle` on a placed resource returns
//!   `E_INVALIDARG`; [`SharedSurface`] therefore allocates a **committed** resource on a
//!   `D3D12_HEAP_FLAG_SHARED` heap.
//! - **The fence is ordered GPU-side**, which is the renderer's wait, not `SetEventOnCompletion`
//!   plus a CPU wait here.
