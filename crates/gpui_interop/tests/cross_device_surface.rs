#![cfg(target_os = "windows")]
//! The cross-device arm, end to end: a **Direct3D 12** producer's shareable texture, opened on
//! GPUI's **Direct3D 11** renderer and composited byte for byte.
//!
//! This is the cross-device case, and the one the built-in same-device path cannot exercise. The
//! producer renders into a committed texture on a `D3D12_HEAP_FLAG_SHARED` heap, hands over its NT
//! handle, and GPUI's Direct3D 11 device opens it with `OpenSharedResource1` and samples it through
//! a shader resource view (`gpui_interop::SharedSurface`). The two queues are ordered by a shared
//! `ID3D12Fence`, signalled on the producer's queue after the clear and waited **GPU-side** on
//! GPUI's device (`ID3D11DeviceContext4::Wait`) — never a CPU poll.
//!
//! # Why the test lives here, and not in `gpui_windows`
//!
//! The renderer is `directx_renderer::DirectXRenderer`, which is `pub(crate)`: an integration test
//! cannot name it, and the test module that models this one is inside the crate
//! (`crates/gpui_windows/src/directx_renderer.rs`). What *is* public is the renderer seam the whole
//! application uses — `Platform`, `PlatformWindow`, and `SceneRenderer` — all of which `gpui`
//! re-exports for every target. So the test builds GPUI's platform with `gpui_windows` (a
//! Windows-only dev-dependency; `gpui_windows` depends on neither `gpui_interop` nor `gpui`, so
//! there is no cycle), opens a hidden window, and reaches the Direct3D 11 renderer through
//! `PlatformWindow::with_renderer` and `PlatformWindow::device_any`. It never names the private
//! renderer type.
//!
//! The producer's own half is raw Direct3D 12 through the `windows` crate, which `gpui_interop`
//! already depends on for `SharedSurface` and `Fence`.
//!
//! # What this test is not
//!
//! It is Windows-only and, on a machine with no Direct3D 12 device (or no DirectComposition), it
//! **skips** rather than fails — the same guard `gpui_windows`'s own renderer tests use. It is
//! deliberately not a Linux/CI-passing test.
